# Service Desk Autopilot

An AI-powered service desk automation system that uses multi-agent architecture to intelligently handle IT support requests, automate common tasks, and streamline help desk operations.

## 🌟 Overview

Service Desk Autopilot is an intelligent automation platform designed to:
- **Triage** incoming support requests automatically
- **Execute** common IT tasks through automated runbooks
- **Escalate** complex issues to human agents when needed
- **Provide** self-service capabilities through natural language understanding
- **Audit** all actions for compliance and tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern where specialized agents handle different aspects of the service desk workflow:

### Core Agents

- **Triage Agent**: Analyzes and categorizes incoming requests
- **Planner Agent**: Creates execution plans for complex tasks
- **Knowledge Agent**: Retrieves relevant information and documentation
- **Runbook Executor Agent**: Executes automated procedures
- **Clarification Agent**: Gathers additional information when needed
- **Enrichment Agent**: Enhances requests with context and metadata
- **Safety Agent**: Validates operations for security and compliance
- **Escalation Agent**: Routes complex issues to human operators

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment support
- Access to required APIs (Azure OpenAI, GitHub Models, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd service-desk-autopilot
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\serviceEnv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ```env
   # AI Model Configuration
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   
   # Service Configuration
   TICKETING_SYSTEM_URL=your-ticketing-url
   DIRECTORY_SERVICE_URL=your-directory-url
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m orchestrator.main
   ```

## 📋 Available Runbooks

Automated procedures for common IT tasks:

- **Password Reset**: Securely reset user passwords
- **Account Status Check**: Verify account status and permissions
- **PTO Balance Lookup**: Check employee vacation balances

## 🔧 Services

The system integrates with various enterprise services:

- **Directory Service**: User account management and authentication
- **HR Service**: Employee information and benefits
- **Ticketing Service**: Incident and request tracking
- **Audit Log Service**: Compliance and activity logging

## 💻 Usage

### API Endpoints

The orchestrator exposes REST API endpoints for:
- Submitting support requests
- Checking task status
- Retrieving execution history
- Managing agent configuration

### Example Request

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/request",
    json={
        "user_id": "user@example.com",
        "message": "I need to reset my password",
        "priority": "normal"
    }
)
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes test datasets in `backend/data/`:
- `train.csv`: Training data for model fine-tuning
- `test.csv`: Test cases for validation
- `HRDataset_v14.csv`: HR information for testing integrations

## 📊 Data Models

Key data structures:

- **Chat**: Conversation and message handling
- **Intent**: Request classification and understanding
- **Plan**: Multi-step task orchestration
- **Runbook**: Automated procedure definitions
- **Escalation**: Routing rules and criteria

## 🔒 Security

- All operations are validated by the Safety Agent
- Audit logging for compliance tracking
- Role-based access control
- Secure credential management

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Agents

1. Create agent class in `backend/agents/`
2. Inherit from `BaseAgent`
3. Implement required methods
4. Register in agent router

### Creating Custom Runbooks

1. Define runbook in `backend/runbooks/`
2. Add metadata to `config/runbook_catalog.json`
3. Implement execution logic
4. Add validation and rollback procedures

## 📝 Configuration

Edit `backend/config/settings.py` to customize:
- Agent behavior and thresholds
- API endpoints and timeouts
- Logging levels
- Runbook parameters
